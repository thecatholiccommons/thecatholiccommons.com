<h1>The Catholic Commons</h1>

<p>
    <b>In order to foster the new evangelization and bring the light of Christ to the world, the
    texts and documents of the Holy Catholic Church should be made as widely available as possible.</b>
    To do this it is essential that we move from restrictive forms of licensing which require
    seeking permission for each use to a wider and more generous license which will permit priests,
    deacons and laity to share the faith of the Church with others by <i>using the texts of the
    Church freely</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Catholics seeking to evangelize by faithfully transmitting the teaching of the Church
    through the use of Her own texts should not be put at risk of unknowingly violating civil
    copyright law.
</p>

<p>
    By using tools such as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons licenses</a>, the
    Church will be able to spread the gospel to all peoples more freely and speedily, while still
    maintaining the integrity of the texts.
</p>

<p>
    It is our hope that in the future all official Church documents will be released under a
    Creative Commons or similar license, so that together we may become  more fruitful in the
    knowledge of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
